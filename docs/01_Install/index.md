## 1. Set up a Drupal 7 Website

To build an application, we first need a Drupal 7 website. For simplicity, we'll want our Drupal 7 website to be available online. This means, we should be able to access the website using the web browser on our mobile device.

Chances are if you are reading this, you already have a Drupal website online (or several). If that is the case, go ahead and jump to step #2. If you are new to Drupal, don't worry, there are plenty of great resources on getting a Drupal 7 website up and running.

 - [Download Drupal](https://drupal.org/download)
 - [Install Drupal](http://drupal.org/documentation/install)

## 2. Enable the DrupalGap Module

For our app to communicate with Drupal, the [DrupalGap module](http://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgap) needs to be enabled. Refer to the [DrupalGap Module Documentation](https://drupal.org/node/1603690) for complete details.

## 3. Install the DrupalGap SDK

With one click, we can [install the SDK](Install/Installing_the_SDK).

## 4. Done!

We're now ready to build an application! When the app loads, it should look something like this:

If you haven't already, we'd recommend completing the [Hello World](Hello_World) for DrupalGap next.
